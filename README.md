# Neural Network Basics - Model Performance Comparision  
## PyTorch & TensorFlow Model Comparison

I wrote this notebook while learning **PyTorch and TensorFlow**. It includes **EDA, data preprocessing, and performance comparison between different models**. The goal is to analyze **train/test accuracy, overfitting, and improvements** across models.

## Steps Performed

1. **EDA & Preprocessing**  
   - Identified data distribution, outliers, and correlations.  
   - Scaled features using **MinMaxScaler** and **PowerTransformer**.  
   - Handled class imbalance with **SMOTE**.

2. **Model Development**  
   - Built base models in **PyTorch and TensorFlow**. 
   - Modified architectures by applying ReLU, dropout, and batch normalizationto to improve performance

3. **Training & Evaluation**  
   - Trained models and evaluated accuracy/loss.  
   - Compared performance across models.
